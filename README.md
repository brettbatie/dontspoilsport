Don't Spoil Sports
==============

A web application that won the **Best App Award** *Sponsored by Twilio* in the [Sports Hack Day - 2013](http://sportshackday.com/) event.

The idea behind this application was to display news, scores and events for sports teams while not revealing any information for user selected teams. This would allow someone to view the latest sports updates while not spoiling the game that they recorded for later viewing.

The website utalized API's from both ESPN an Sports Data.

This application was built in two days by four members: Brett, Frank, Travis, and Dan.
